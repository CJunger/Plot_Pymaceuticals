## Plot_Pymaceuticals
Plotting with Pandas and Numpy

Generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
Create a top-level summary of the study results.

This is broken down into the following tasks:
-Prepare the data.
-Generate summary statistics.
-Create bar charts and pie charts.
-Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
-Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
-Calculate correlation and regression.
-Submit your final analysis.

### Summary Analysis

The Capomulin drug regimen in comparison to the other drugs is very effective. The only other drug that is possibly more effective would be Ramicane.  Ramicane and Capomulin had the smallest tumor volumes during treatment and also the smallest margin of error.
